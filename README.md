# week-3-game
This is a Hangman game which uses Javascript interactivity such as onKeyUp events, document object methods, and native String and Array methods. It is styled using Bootswatch Journal theme and additional styles using Google fonts, images, and colors. 
The game is customized for the theme of Harry Potter spells. It has a responsive layout for mobile. 

The game starts as soon as the page is loaded/ refreshed. The user hits a letter key to make a guess. Once the maximum number of guesses (7) run out, the user loses the round. On the other hand, if the user guesses the spell, then a win is counted. In order to play the next round, the user must hit any key, and is instructed to hit the space bar.
