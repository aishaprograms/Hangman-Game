# Hangman-Game
Update (3/3/2017): This is one of my earlier developed apps. I updated the layout and broke the functions down into smaller blocks of functional code. If I were to redo this app, I would rewrite much of the game.js code to be more readable and nonrepetitive. 

Get out your wand! It's time to guess which Harry Potter spell will get you out of a bind.

The game is customized for the theme of Harry Potter spells. It starts as soon as the page is loaded/ refreshed. The user hits a letter key to make a guess. Once the maximum number of guesses (7) run out, the user loses the round. On the other hand, if the user guesses the spell, then a win is counted. In order to play the next round, the user must hit any key, and is instructed to hit the space bar.

This Hangman game  uses Javascript DOM manipulation such as onKeyUp events, document object methods, and native String and Array methods. It is styled using Bootswatch Journal theme and additional styles using Google fonts, images, and colors. It has a responsive layout for mobile.
